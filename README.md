My attempt at implementing a perceptron algorithm.

In this learning example, I have created a python class "Perceptron", which is described in the perceptron.py file. It posesses 3 methods, .fit which updates the weights according to the learning data,
.net_input, which calculates the dot product of all the weights and returns the calculated value. Finally, .predict take this calculated value and returns the predicted class label, 0 or 1.
